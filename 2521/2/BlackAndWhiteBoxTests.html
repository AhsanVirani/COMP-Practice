  <blockquote>
    <p>Inspired somewhat by Matt Might’s “reply-to-all” approach to
(academic) blogging, and assuming that what I keep here could be
considered a blog, here’s my response to a student question from a
<a href="https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP1927/17x1/">COMP1927</a> class.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Curtis&nbsp;Millar for several intelligent and thoughtful
comments that improved this write-up immensely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I am a bit confused at how to write white box tests, as all I can
find on it are definitions of what white box testing is, with no
examples.  I consulted my tutor, who said white box testing and
black box testing were essentially the same […]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, good gods, no.</p>

<p>There’s two halves to the testing story.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have this interface.</p>

<pre><code>// Bag.h
typedef struct bag *Bag;
Bag bag_new (void); // create a new Bag
void bag_delete (Bag); // destroy a Bag
void bag_insert (Bag, int item); // add an item to the Bag
size_t bag_size (Bag); // get the Bag size
bool bag_contains (Bag, int item); // does Bag contain `item`?
</code></pre>

<p>Black-box testing, as you know, follows the shape of the specification
and its interface to determine whether an implementation conforms to it.</p>

<p>To write and perform black-box tests, it isn’t necessary to know how a
particular implementation ‘does things’ – the layout of structures,
the inner workings of helper functions, etc.  It can, and should, be
treated as a “black box”; hence the name.</p>

<p>For our Bag, we may like to write tests for the <code>bag_size</code> function
that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// in BagTest.c
void test_bag_size (void) {
    Bag b = bag_new();
    assert (bag_size (b) == 0);

    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
        bag_insert (b, i);
        assert (bag_size (b) == (size_t)i);
    }

    assert (bag_size (b) == 10);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It’s worth noting that we’re testing here for correct behaviour.  It’s
slightly harder to deal with testing for incorrect behaviour, unless
you’ve defined various boundary behaviours to use for robustness
testing – and in any case, that becomes part of the spec, and can and
should be tested anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p>White-box testing, on the other hand, is highly subjective (and much
harder to automate because of that).  It’s testing <em>with</em> awareness of
the inner structure of structures, functions, etc., and there are many
approaches to it.  At our level, though, here’s two you’ll want to
use.</p>

<p>The first approach, and I feel the easiest to implement, is to follow
a similar tack to how you would write black-box tests: you set up some
input conditions, call a function, then check the output matches your
expectations.</p>

<p>Instead of, as you would have done with black-box testing, examining
isolated return values as outputs from the purposely small ‘surface
area’ exposed by the interface functions, with white-box testing you
must examine the state of your ADT.  Every piece of data you
meaningfully store, every byte referenced by or held in your type’s
structure becomes fair game for inspection.</p>

<p>Such tests would have to, of course, sit in one or more functions, to
keep your code clean, and by necessity it must live in your
implementation file.</p>

<p>Let’s assume our Bag is implemented as a linked-list stack.  There
are, of course, other implementations you could use here: arrays,
queues, trees, heaps, etc. etc. etc.</p>

<pre><code>// in Bag.c
struct bag {
    struct bag_node *top;
    size_t n_items;
};
struct bag_node {
    int item;
    struct bag_node *next;
};

#define for_each_bag_node(first,this) \
    for (struct bag_node *this = first; \
        this != NULL; this = this-&gt;next)

// ... some actual implementation elided...
</code></pre>

<p>How would we go about writing tests, then?  We have to be aware of the
shape of our implementation, of course.</p>

<pre><code>// still in Bag.c
void white_box_tests (void) {
    wbt_bag_size ();
    // and other tests
}

static void wbt_bag_size (void) {
    Bag b = bag_new ();
    assert (b-&gt;size == 0);
    assert (b-&gt;top == NULL);
    assert (b-&gt;size == bag_size (b));

    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
        bag_insert (b, i);
        assert (b-&gt;size == i);
        assert (b-&gt;top != NULL);

        size_t node_count = 0;
        for_each_bag_node (b-&gt;top, curr) {
            node_count++;
        }
        assert (node_count == b-&gt;size &amp;&amp; node_count == i);

        assert (b-&gt;size == bag_size (b));
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This looks a lot like the black box tests above, but instead of using
the interface, I’m stabbing into my ADT structures, I’m walking along
the list I hold to ensure the number of nodes in the list actually
matches the number of nodes I think I have, etc.</p>

<p>Each implementation would have its own white-box tests.  Some would be
more complex than others, by the very nature of the implementation;
some would be simpler.  But each implementation has a <em>distinct</em> set
of tests, which cannot be swapped into another implementation, unlike
black-box tests which are purposefully implementation agnostic.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another approach is to use the assert(3) macro/function at every point
to confirm that your conditions, or “invariants”, hold: for example,
that your head and tail pointers are the same iff there is only one
node, or that each node’s previous node’s next node is itself.</p>

<p>This approach takes significantly more work, is more invasive into
your code, and you have to almost engineer it in, but you may find
this approach can be a bit more thorough, and allow for cleaner
design.  You’ll encounter more of this sort of idea in software
engineering courses.</p>

<p>Going back to our Bag ADT, let’s have a look at what this would look
like for the <code>bag_size</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>// back in Bag.c
size_t bag_size (struct bag *b) {
    // pre-conditions
    assert ((b != NULL) &amp;&amp;
        ((b-&gt;size == 0 &amp;&amp; b-&gt;top == NULL) ||
         (b-&gt;size &gt; 0  &amp;&amp; b-&gt;top != NULL)));

    return b-&gt;size;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And let’s have a quick look at <code>bag_insert</code> while we’re here.</p>

<pre><code>void bag_insert (struct bag *b, int value) {
    // pre-conditions
    assert ((b != NULL) &amp;&amp;
        ((b-&gt;size == 0 &amp;&amp; b-&gt;top == NULL) ||
         (b-&gt;size &gt; 0  &amp;&amp; b-&gt;top != NULL)));

    struct bag_node *bn = bag_node_new (value);
    assert (bn != NULL &amp;&amp; bn-&gt;item == value);
    bn-&gt;next = b-&gt;top;
    b-&gt;top = bn;
    b-&gt;size++;

    // post-conditions
    assert (b-&gt;size &gt; 0 &amp;&amp;
        b-&gt;top != NULL &amp;&amp;
        b-&gt;top-&gt;item == value);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This looks much more complex, but the core of the function is still
the same: create a node, prepend it to the list.  We merely make
statements about the nature of the bag before and after we do so, and
ensure that those statements hold (or the program goes away).</p>

<p>You could probably, with some thought, expand the pre-condition and
post-conditions to ensure that (more of) the integrity of the list
holds, though it would become messy with more than a few nodes.</p>

<p>(In fact, as I was writing this example, I stuffed up and forgot to
increment <code>b-&gt;size</code>… and then wrote the post-condition assertion and
realised my mistake.)</p>

<p>As a marker, I’d consider that this strategy shows you have a better
understanding of the code you’ve written because, by its very nature,
it encourages clearer code through more thorough use of abstraction to
isolate common code, which can radically affect your design.</p>

<p>For example, instead of seeing you iterate through a list until some
counter matches some other value, you may have a function that gets
the nth line of the list, and you would be able to test this in either
a separate function, or merely assert your expectations.</p>

<p>Both strategies can be used together, too.</p>

<p>It’s probably a bit hard to graft the latter strategy into your
assignment code at this stage, what with the deadline mere hours
ago…  but I hope this is at least somewhat enlightening about the
shape and nature of testing strategies.</p>
